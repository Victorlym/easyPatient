Patient Management System

This is a patient management system. So the Doctor or assistant can use this system to easily set appointment and manage appointment.

Functions are:

1.Patient can easily make appointment with doctors. 
2.Dashboard can show all the patient appointment
3.Patient can easily be searched

Limitations:
Becasue of the limit of time, a universal dashboard for all the patients are implemented. 
The usecase is limited to be used by doctors and assistant only.

Future improvement.
A login for every patient, so that privacy can be protected.
A dashboard for patient to view patient's own appointment.
